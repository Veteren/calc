# calc

Calc is a functional calculator written C

And I didn't use any loop

## USAGE

```BASH
$./calc <operation> <arg1> <arg2> <arg3> ...
```

### OPERATIONS

OPS | + | - | x | / 
---  | --- |--- |--- |--- 
OPS | add | subtract | multiply | divide
 
### For Example
```BASH
$./calc + 2 1
result :3
```
